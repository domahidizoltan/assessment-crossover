### Project Assessment:
Cross-Solar is a backend web application created by a startup company called “Green Energy Analytics” in Texas - USA. This application collects energy analytics for solar panels every hour.


### Notes:
- Project accepts data for registered panels only, and to register panel; serial number must be 16 characters length, and latitude/longitude contains 6 decimal places.
- Frontend application excluded from the current scope. It is a separate, fully-functioning application handled by another team, so we do not want to modify it.


### Tasks:
1)	Increase unit test coverage to reach 60%, achieving more than 60% will only consume your valuable time without extra score.
2)	Find bugs and fix them, hint: we provided Cross-Solar application in a good structure, so no need to spend your valuable time on structure modifications,  just focus on fixing bugs.
3) 	Frontend team wants to display panel’s all historical data in a chart, in which each point represents electricity generated by this panel each day [sum, min, max, average] up to the end of previous day , your goal is to implement backend part of this task, API specifications already there in code as agreed with Frontend team, and it is ok to implement this task without any optimization.


### Prerequisites:
- Any IDE
- Java 8
- MySQL 5.6+


### Development Environment:

##### Mysql:
CrossSolar applications require MYSQL database to store its data. Make sure to update application.properties with spring.datasource.url(change hostname only), spring.datasource.username, and  spring.datasource.password. You are free to choose MySQl service in a cloud or installed on local machine or MySQL container.
    
CrossSolar application uses liquibase for Database changes. In case you need to update Database, please create a new changeset file in resources/db.changelog folder and include the newly created file in db.changelog-master.xml  
For more details on liquibase follow https://www.liquibase.org/documentation/changeset.html 

### CrossSolar Application:
To start the application run CrossSolarApplication.java main method from your IDE.


### Production Environment:
This is how we are going to run and evaluate your submission, so please make sure to run below steps before submitting your answer.  

1) Make sure to run unit tests,check code coverage, ensure application is compiling and all dependencies are included.
2) Commit everything using (git add --all && git commit -m "My submission")
3) Create patch file with name without spaces 'cross-solar-java_<YourNameHere>.patch', using the specified tag as the starting point (git format-patch initial-commit --stdout > cross-solar-java_<yournamehere>.patch)
4) Store your file in a shared location where Crossover team can access and download it for evaluation. and add your sharable link in the answer field of this question.
